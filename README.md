Pi Heat
=======

Remote heating control via Raspberry Pi.

Uses [dweet.io](http://dweet.io/) for asynchronous communication.


Allowed JSON messages
---------------------

All messages are JSON and have a `type` field indicating the type.


### Status messages

Status messages are sent by the device to report current heating status.

```json
{
  "type": "status",
  "status": "on|off",
  "temp": 123,
  "msgexp_s": 123,
  "msgupd_s": 123,
  "name": "thing's friendly name"
}
```

* `status`: a `String` indicating the heating status. Can be **on** or **off**.
  Values are case-insensitive.
* `temp` *(optional)*: a `Decimal` value with the current temperature in Â°C.
* `msgexp_s` *(optional)*: an `Integer` value used to tell the client what is
  the maximum validity of a dweet.
* `msgupd_s` *(optional)*: an `Integer` value used to tell the client what is
  the status update rate of the server.
* `name` *(optional)*: a `String` with the thing's friendly name.


### Commands

Commands are sent by clients to control heating.

```json
{
  "type": "command",
  "command": "turnon|turnoff|status"
}
```

Command is a case-insensitive string. Possible commands:

* **turnon**: requests to turn heating on
* **turnoff**: requests to turn heating off
* **status**: requests device to report status


Client configuration
--------------------

Web client does not require a web server: everything runs in the browser. On the
server, though, a configuration file must be provided.

It must be placed in `js/private-config.js` and it contains a JSON-formatted
configuration like the following:

```json
piheat_config = {
  "thingid": "<thingid>",
  "default_msg_expiry_s": 12345,
  "default_msg_update_s": 12345
};
```

All the configuration variables are **mandatory**: the client will stop and
issue a warning if they are not configured.

* **thingid**: the "thing" identifier as on [dweet.io](http://dweet.io). As all
  dweets are public, and there is no registration needed, everybody can "dweet"
  in place of your thing, so set a difficult-to-guess name, like a UUID. It must
  be the same on the client and on the server.
* **default_msg_expiry_s**: default message expiration time, will be overridden
  by an optional value sent by the server inside status messages. All dweets
  older than the specified number of seconds will be considered expired, and
  therefore ignored.
* **default_msg_update_s**: default message update rate (*i.e.* interval
  between) two consecutive status requests to the server.


Encrypted messages
------------------

Encrypted JSON-serialized objects can be sent in place of regular cleartext
objects. Encryption uses the **AES-CBC-256** cipher, and binary data is encoded
using **base64**.

This is the format of an encrypted message:

```json
{
  "payload": "<base64-encoded-json-message>",
  "nonce": "<base64-encoded>"
}
```

* **payload**: contains the original JSON serialized object in base64 notation.
* **nonce**: the initialization vector used for encrypting the message, in
  base64 notation. This must be 16 bytes long.


Original payload is a JSON *status* or *command* object as described above.
